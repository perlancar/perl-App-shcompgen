	  0.68+.


0.07    2014-12-17 (PERLANCAR)

	- Tweak/fix init script for bash: forgot to return 124 when
	  completion script exists (so user still needed extra tab), don't
	  use bash-completion scripts when bash-completion is not active.


0.06    2014-12-14 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Rebuild with new version of DZP::shcompgen::InitOnInstall (show output
          of init, though most users won't see this because they will install
          using 'cpanm' without the -v option).


0.05    2014-12-14 (PERLANCAR)

        - Support multiple global/per-user dirs (e.g. bash has global completion
          scripts dir in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions as well as
          /etc/bash_completion.d).

        - [ux] Run 'shcompgen init' and 'shcompgen generate --replace' during
          install, for user's convenience.

        - [Bugfix] Regression: File::Which *was* needed, but removed.

        - [Bugfix] in shcompgen.bashrc: Return 124 instead of 0, otherwise we'll
          need an extra Tab when completing a new command which is annoying
          (UPDATE: but extra Tab is still needed?)

        - Tweak completion routines.


0.04    2014-12-13 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Use the correct completee.

	- Add completion for 'generate'.

	- Add completion for 'remove'.


0.03    2014-12-13 (PERLANCAR)

        - [Bugfix] Fix typo that caused per-user completion directory not
          created during init (despite the success message).

        - Minor tweaks.


0.02    2014-12-13 (PERLANCAR)

        - Rename module/dist from App-ShellCompletionInstaller to App-shcompgen.

        - [ux] Change interface to use subcommands.

        - [Bugfix] Fix loader function for bash: forgot to pass argument to
          _completion_loader.

        - [ux] Add subcommand: 'init', to help ease initialization.


0.01    2014-12-12 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release, an evolution from App-BashCompletionProg and
          App-BashCompletionF; this one supports multiple shells and works with
          shells' standard completion scripts layout. Another advantage is the
          completion scripts can be activated on the current shell (instead of
          waiting to start a new shell) because we use on-demand loading (e.g.
          'complete -D' on bash). Early release though, only supports bash.
