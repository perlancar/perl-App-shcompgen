Revision history for App-ShellCompletionInstaller

0.01    2014-12-12 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release, an evolution from App-BashCompletionProg and
          App-BashCompletionF; this one supports multiple shells and works with
          shells' standard completion scripts layout. Another advantage is the
          completion scripts can be activated on the current shell (instead of
          waiting to start a new shell) because we use on-demand loading (e.g.
          'complete -D' on bash). Early release though, only supports bash.
